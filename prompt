ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify key requirements from user input:
   - Hardware type (GPU mentioned?)
   - Network fabric (Ethernet vs InfiniBand)
   - Performance requirements (high-performance, maximum throughput)
   - Sharing model (dedicated vs shared resources)
   - Isolation requirements (multi-tenancy, network isolation)

2. Consider default choices:
   - For GPU clusters with standard Ethernet: `sriovnet_rdma`
   - For InfiniBand with SR-IOV: `sriovibnet_rdma`
   - For InfiniBand with sharing: `ipoib_rdma_shared_device`

3. Look for specific keywords:
   - "GPU", "machine learning", "AI" → likely `sriovnet_rdma`
   - "InfiniBand", "IB" → consider `sriovibnet_rdma` or `ipoib_rdma_shared_device`
   - "maximum performance", "HPC" → consider `hostdev_rdma_sriov`
   - "isolation", "multi-tenant" → consider `macvlan_rdma_shared_device`

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only a JSON object with your selection and reasoning:

```json

  "selected_usecase": "usecase_name",
