ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify key requirements from user input:
   - Hardware type (GPU mentioned?)
   - Network fabric (Ethernet or InfiniBand, default to Ethernet unless there are strong reasons to use Infiniband)
   - Deployment type (sriov, rdma_shared or hostdev)
   - Single or multirail
   - Spectrum-X platform or not (only when explicitely mentioned by user)
   - Cluster is used for AI use cases

3. Look for specific keywords:
   - "GPU", "machine learning", "AI" → likely `deploymentType: sriov`
   - "InfiniBand", "IB" → `fabric: infiniband`
   - "multiple networks", "multirail" → likely `multirail: true`
   - "llm training", "ai inference" → likely `ai: true`

4. Analyze the cluster configuration below

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only a JSON object of the format below with your selection and reasoning. If one or more parameters cannot be directly deduced from the user prompt, set the confidence to low. Don't add ```json ``` formatting:

{
  "fabric": "ethernet|infiniband"
  "deploymentType": "sriov|rdma_shared|hostdev"
  "multirail": "true|false"
  "spectrumX": "true|false"
  "ai": "true|false"
  "confidence": "high|low",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this use case was selected or error was returned",
  "key_factors": "factor 1; factor 2' factor 3"
}
